/* NETWORK PROTOCOL (Note that the `html' tags are documentation only):
 *
 * The connection starts with experiment info, in its own packet.
 * <EXPERIMENT INFO>
 *   From Byte 0:
 *     "period:  (user-specified)\n"
 *     "event1:  (user-specified)\n"
 *       ...
 *     "eventn:  (user-specified)\n"
 *     '\0'
 * </EXPERIMENT INFO>
 *
 *   NOTE:  the user specified data is not necessarily in any format,
 *          the user may very well have included new-lines.  let us
 *          hope that the user only placed numeric info there
 *
 * We then follow with repeated packets of sampling information:
 * <HEAD>
 *   Byte 0:  1 if Kernel, 0 if User
 *   Byte 1:  number of counters (so 0 up to 256)
 *   Byte 2:  core id (so we are limited for now to 256 cores)
 *   Byte 3:  number samples present (so 0 up to 256)
 *   UINT (Byte 4,5,6,7):  batch number of transmission
 *   UINT (Byte 8,9,10,11):  samples missed FOR THIS ENTIRE BATCH
 *   UINT (Byte 12,13,14,15):  item number within this batch
 *   UINT (Byte 16,17,18,19):  pid of the sample
 * </HEAD>
 *
 * <BODY>
 *   <SAMPLE>
 *     UINT (4 Bytes): # cycles spent
 *     UINT (4 Bytes): zeroeth counter...
 *        ...
 *     UINT (4 Bytes): i'th counter
 *   </SAMPLE>
 *
 *   <SAMPLE>
 *     ...
 *   </SAMPLE>
 *
 *   NUL terminated string for command line.
 *       Empty if the previous item transmitted was for the same pid.
 *   NUL terminated string for executable.
 *       Empty if the previous item transmitted was for the same pid.
 * </BODY>
